This project concerns a regression analysis of the rate of warming in North America across two periods, 1950-1980 and 1980-2010, 
in addition to an analysis of different rates of warming across North America. The purpose of the first part of the analysis is 
to see if there has been a statistically significant increase in the rate of global surface warming over the latter half of the 
20th century, and more recently, in the last 30 years. 

I am using ordinary least-squares regression to calculate the slope of the observed trends in surface temperature in North America
across the aforementioned periods (I have started by regressing a bigger chunk of the data, from 1901-2010 and then from 1979-2010).
A simple t-test indicates that annualized surface warming rates using February as a baseline of +0.007 C from 1901-2010 and of
+0.0305 C from 1979 to 2010 are significant with p-values < 0.001.
